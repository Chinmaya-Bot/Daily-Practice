Today I learned about the order of growth and  complexity:
The Five major notation are:
1)Big-O: Upper Bound 

2)Big-Theta: Tightly Bound
3)Big-Omega:Lower Bound
4)Small-O:Upper Bound
5)Small-Omega:Lower Bound

The above link represents the various time complexity in graphical form

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Orders_of_common_functions
the above the link tells about all the different types of complexities

But there is one complexities which is not given is Iterated logarithm
